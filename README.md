Senior Software semester 1 project


To run the chat room, you'll need three terminals and do the following on each terminal IN ORDER.

Terminal 1:
Type in python server.py IPADRESS PORTNO. python server.py localhost 8081 is a good example.

Terminal 2:
Type in python client.py IPADRESS PORTNO, python client.py localhost 8081 is a good example


Terminal 3:
Type in python client.py IPADRESS PORTNO, python client.py localhost 8081 is a good example

Now, terminal 2 and 3 will act as people who can chat in the room. Terminal 1 will act as the room.
